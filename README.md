# What this is:

This is a Red discord bot cog (A litle add on) that can reply to, and transcribe voice messages using the OpenAi Whisper API.

I haven't seen someone do anything like this before (transcription of discord voice messages), so I figured I should try to make it.

Adding to the Red Discord Bot ecosystem should allow more people to add it to their servers easily, as it's a very popular discord bot framework.

I think voice messages are a great way to express how you're feeling asynchronously, but you have to listen to the full message.

This bot allows you to know what's going to be said, before it's said.

# TODO:

- Update the code to add an option to use a local Whisper instance instead of API calls

# How can I help?

Open an issue if something breaks

# Requirements:

- Open AI developer account with an API key that allows the bot to read models available to it and the /audio endpoint
- Discord
- Computer to run the bot on\
